# My Portfolio Website

Hii 👋 this is my personal portfolio website built using **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Framer Motion**. it has animated sections like About, Education, Skills, Projects, and Contact — with smooth transitions, a typing effect, floating visuals, and a clean modern look.

## 💬 a quick honest note

i wanna be real here — i used **ChatGPT** a lot while making this.  
but not just to get code and paste it. i already knew some basics of HTML, CSS, and JS, and this project was my way of pushing myself way beyond that.

i didn’t want to just build something simple. i wanted a real, functional, and good-looking site like the ones pros make. so every time i got stuck — layout, animations, bugs, logic — i asked for help.  
but i also read the answers, learned *why* things work, and improved my understanding every single time.

this project is not just code. it's me leveling up.

## 🧠 what i actually learned

- how to structure a Next.js project from scratch  
- writing and styling clean UI using Tailwind  
- smooth animations using Framer Motion  
- building interactive sections and custom effects  
- fixing bugs, breaking code, fixing it again 😅  
- deploying it to Vercel and making it live  

i could’ve taken shortcuts, but i chose to understand everything i could. and now i can confidently build more projects like this (maybe even better ones 👀).

## 🚀 what's next

this is just my first proper portfolio site — but not the last.  
i’m already planning more projects, and with what i’ve learned here, i’ll try building them more independently now.  

i’ll always use tools like ChatGPT when needed (like any smart dev would), but my goal is to rely more on *what i’ve built up inside my brain* too 😄

## 🎯 why i made this

i wanted a place where i could show who i am, what i’ve learned, and what i’m building. this portfolio is fully mine — even if i had help along the way.  

i’m still learning and getting better, but i’m actually proud of this one. every section, every animation — i get how it all works now. didn’t fully get it but, figured it out while building.
